# **Particle**: a quick physics sim using Lua and Love2d

This sim is my attempt to follow the blog post ["Physics Engines for Dummies"][1] by Paul Firth. Right now all it does is to spawn off 20 particles and move them around a window. Future enhancements will be to use vectors, normals, gravity, etc.
